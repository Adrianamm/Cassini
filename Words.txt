A huge planet, ten times as big as Earth, might be hiding on the edge of our solar system. 
FIRST(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded by inventor Dean Kamen to inspire young people’s interest in science and technology. 
Gracious Professionalism is part of the ethos of FIRST. It’s a way of doing things that encourages high quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. 
The ARCADE includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play FIRST POWER: the FIELD, SWITCHES, the SCALE, VAULTS, carpet, the POWER CUBES, and all equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT control, and scorekeeping. 
Control the Switches and the Scale. Robots collect Power Cubes and place them on Plates to control Switches or the Scale. When the Scale or their Switch is tipped in their favor, it is considered owned by that Alliance. Alliances work to have Ownership for as much time as possible. 
RECYCLE RUSH is a recycling-themed game designed for the 2015 
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). It is played by two Alliances of three Teams each. Alliances compete simultaneously to score points by stacking Totes on Scoring Platforms, capping those stacks with Recycling Containers, and properly disposing of Litter, represented by pool noodles, in designated locations. In keeping with the recycling theme of the game, all scoring elements used are reusable or recyclable by teams in their home locations or by FIRST at the end of the season.
During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds of the Match, called the Teleop Period, Robots are controlled remotely by student drivers  located behind the walls at the ends of the Field. Teams on an Alliance work together to place as many Totes on their Scoring Platforms as possible. Alliances earn additional points for Recycling Containers placed on the scored Totes, with Recycling Containers at greater heights  earning more points.  
Fuck recycle rush man 
Some teams cant get fucking blue banners
recycle rush was a fucking horriable game 
You are playing a fucking awful game that is called recycle rush
